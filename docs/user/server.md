# LeForum User Documentation
## Server
LeForum is not some kind of running-right-now-somewhere project, there are no "officially running" servers. The idea of LeForum is to allow enthusiasts run  their own servers and to allow users connect to any server they like (relying hosting on community, yay!)

LeForum Server is a program that should run infinitely, therefore it is a good idea to run it on some server, as background task (screen, daemon or Docker, which is preferable).

Usage guidelines can be found [here](server_usage.md)
