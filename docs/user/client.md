# LeForum User Documentation
## Client
Client allows to connect to some LeForum Server, find some thread or create your own one, post messages there and view thread message history. Please note that any client (including not official ones) has to (or at least should) implement all the presented functionality.

Current default LeForum client is a CLI program. Its usage can be found [here](client_usage.md).
