## Server usage
#### General
LeForum Server has no interface. After parsing all the command line arguments, server runs and falls into an infinite loop of accepting clients. Therefore, as mentioned above, you should run it in background (the best option is Docker with volume to save all the data).

---

#### Command line arguments
Short exaplanation of all the arguments is available by running server program with `--help`/`--usage` flag.
